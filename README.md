# libcvhash
Consistent Virtual Node Hash library.
We are trying to implement 10 "physical machines" (actually, they are not the reality) with 10,000,000 objects injecting for this test. 
After finishing the test, it will show you the result about hashing mapping ratio for each physical machine.

# Dependency
libapr.apr_md5.
Acturally, you can remove md5_hash method in oryx_cvhash.c to cut this dependency down.

# How to run this library
$ make
$ ./cv_hash

# Result implement
A good hashing must satisfied 3 principles: Balance,Monotonicity,Spread(Load).
# 1st, Balancing test. we can see how 1000000 objects balanced to 10 machines from this test.
